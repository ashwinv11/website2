      about: |
        I created the website for CalArts' Digital Arts Expo for 2015.
        Since other people had to add content to the site, I created it in Wordpress.
        The website has been archived %{href}, but I am working with the school's IT department
        to get it up and running.

        I also leaded development on the website for CalArts' Digital Arts Expo for 2016.
        This was also created in Wordpress. Check it out %{href}.
    censored:
      intro: |
        Censored is an interactive website that visualizes statistics on sexual assault and rape cases in India.
        The data is taken from the Open Government Data Platform of India, which is used by the
        Government of India to publish their datasets for public use. Although this is a step in the right
        direction, these numbers are only reported cases till the year 2013. Most cases aren't reported.
        Many cases are buried under bureaucracy and corruption. In Maharashtra alone, the number of reported
        cases has <strong>more than doubled</strong> in just 4 years. Today’s numbers are unknown,
        but we can only imagine what they are.
      repo: |
        The animations in this video are slowed down due to the screen recording.
        The website is still under  development and I intend on bring more features and data available
        to the public. Source code can be found %{href}.
      paper: |
        I also wrote an extensive paper that talks about the background behind the project and the implementation.
        Check that out %{href}.
    digital_reflections:
      about: |
        Digital Reflections is an interactive mixed reality piece. You see yourself in the mirror,
        but you also see a digital representation of yourself. This breaks down the dichotomy between
        the physical and digital world, creating another reality. Wave your hands and make some noise
        to see your reflection change.
